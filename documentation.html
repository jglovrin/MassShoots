<p>I chose to do a visualization on mass shootings because despite all the news coverage and social media buzz around mass shootings and gun control, I very rarely see data-driven graphics about them. I think it important people's beliefs regarding the frequency and impact of these events are data-driven instead of being influenced by media exposure.</p>
<p>This visualization was built from data scraped from the Wikipedia article "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_shootings_in_the_United_States">Mass Shootings in the United States</a>" and contains all the mass shootings from 2017 to 2021 separated into CSVs by year. I chose this source both because it was easily accessible and public domain, but also because it is independently collected and unbiased.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The design of the graph is very simple, allowing people to see a representation of each mass shooting's death toll and the date on which it happened. Hovering over an individual point shows a blurb description of that event, mostly just because the wiki data had descriptions ready to go. Radio buttons&nbsp;</p>
<p>The graph does not tell a particular story because I wanted to make sure that people could form their own opinions from the data. I, myself, don't have any idea how to interpret the data necessary and so it wouldn't feel right to present my own view of the issue with my graph.&nbsp;</p>
